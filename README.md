# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP-ML-and-a-GUI-Sentiment-Analyser
Sentiment Analysis is performed on twitter data obtained.

For Analysis using NLP and ML:

Check the distribution of tweets in the data. It is to
be noted we have test and train data in hand. Define a

Countvectorizer function to convert text into a represen-
tation of corresponding frequency.

A word cloud is then defined to show the most frequent
word with bigger and distinct letters, and with different
colors.

Then, we collect hashtags by extracting them from certain
types of tweets.

We label the tweets collected and remove unwanted
patterns from them.

Stemming is applied to extract the stem and join them
back.

A bag of words model is then created and thus extracting
all key features.

After this, we ideally want to apply our ML model.For
this, we first split the training data into train and valid
sets so that we can evaluate the performance of the model
we apply.

Four ML models are then applied, namely: Random
Forest; Decision Tree; Logistic Regression, and XBG.

A confusion matrix is obtained and we check the accuracy
associated with each model.

For GUI based Sentiment Anlayser:

For developing the web application, we have used “Flask” package, which is basically a web

application framework.

Naives Bayes has been used for classifying on the basis of positive and negative sentiment(sentence).
